# These are *names* (aliases) you assign when creating the coldkey and hotkey.
# You can create a new one for mining/validating like `btcli wallet new_coldkey --wallet.name mywallet`

# This key stays offline and is used for staking, registration, and ownership.
BT_WALLET_COLD=default

# 2. BT_WALLET_HOT — the name you gave your hotkey (e.g., "myhotkey")
# You can create a new one `btcli wallet new_hotkey --wallet.name mywallet --wallet.hotkey myhotkey`
# Note that mywallet here is the same from the previous set.
# This key is safe to use online and used for mining, validation, or inference.
